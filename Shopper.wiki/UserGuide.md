## Overview of Shopper ##

Shopper is an Android App designed for 10" Tablets with the primary purpose of generating an ordered shopping list. 

### The Structure ###

#### Stores, Aisles and Products ####
The Structre is simalar to the structure of Stores (the term **Store** is used rather than Shop to reduce ambiguity between " a shop" and "to shop"). The structure being that a shop will have an area or areas, **Aisle** or Aisles for the sake of combining the various possible terms, in which **Products** are available to be purchased. As such, **Shopper's** main menu includes buttons for **Stores**, **Aisles** and **Products**.

#### To Get and Shopping ####
Shopping involves adding products to a list (could be a jotted on a notepad or kept in your head); generally you go to a shop because you want to get something from the shop. As such Shopper also has a **To Get** button on the main menu. Of course when you get to the shop you are Shopping. So Shopper also has a **Shopping** button. 

#### Rules ####

Shopper attempts to help you out with generating the shopping list by a feature called **Rules** (yes that's a button as well). Rules are used to automatically add regular purchases to the shopping list. A rule can also be semi-automated requiring you to decide wether or not you wan to include the product purchase via a prompt.

#### A Note about the buttons on the main display ####

Shopper attempts to avoid some confusion by only display usable buttons. For example if there are no Stores then you cannot have a Aisle. As such, when you first use Shopper only the **Stores** and **Products** buttons are shown.

#### A Note about Products ####

Products can be a little confusing to understand. Let's use an analogy with "Heinz Baked Beans". Your local corner store can stock and thus sell them, your chain store may also. So this one product can be purchased at multiple locations.

 However, you don't want to be typing in "Heinz Baked Beans" as the name of the product numerous times (*Shopper is trying to help you not make you it's slave*). Therefore, a product is placed into an **Aisle** or **Aisles**, for want of a better word Shopper uses the term **Stock**, as in to stock an Aisle. Of course, to expand upon the analogy, if the corner shop doesn't have "Heinz Baked Beans" in stock then you can't purchase them. In the case of Shopper, if you don't place a product in an **Aisle** (i.e **Stock** the Aisle or Aisles), then you can't add it to the shopping list via the **To Get** button. Likewise, you also can make a **Rule** for that product. As such if there are no Stores, Aisles or Products then the **To Get** and **Rules** button aren't available. Furthermore as there can be nothing in the Shopping List (only the **To Get** or **Rules** can add to the Shopping List) then the **Shopping** button is not available.

In short a product needs to be added to at least one **Aisle**.
